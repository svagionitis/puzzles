"Your tenacity for making things that make other things so that people can make things is alarming." -a beta tester

Hi! I'm Eric Wastl. I made Advent of Code. I hope you like it! I also made [Vanilla JS](http://vanilla-js.com/), [PHP Sadness](http://phpsadness.com/), and [lots of other things](http://was.tl/projects/). You can find me on Twitter and GitHub.

Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme.

If you'd like to support Advent of Code, you can do so indirectly by helping to [Share on Twitter Google+ Reddit] it with others, or directly via [Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_flow&SESSION=1iXlqfs1M_MlfhpXCtBrBfSwUCT20Ny323H4Ebe_98X9BWKbVrH65ZMPxVi&dispatch=50a222a57771920b6a3d7b606239e4d529b525e0b7e69bf0224adecfb0124e9b61f737ba21b081984719ecfa9a8ffe80733a1a700ced90ae) or [bitcoin](bitcoin:1B9EpgakHBRPxdYkSiqHBAeYB22XPBX2WG?label=AdventOfCode).

General Tips
-------------

If you get stuck, try your solution against the examples given in the puzzle; you should get the same answers. If not, re-read the description. Did you misunderstand something? Is your program doing something you don't expect? After the examples work, if your answer still isn't correct, build some test cases for which you can verify the answer by hand and see if those work with your program. If you're still stuck, maybe ask a friend for help, or come back to the puzzle later. You can also ask for hints in the [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/).

If you really think your solution is correct but your answer isn't accepted, and you think there might be a mistake in the puzzle itself because nobody else is solving it either (check the [stats page](http://adventofcode.com/stats)), let me know via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ericwastl). My beta testers and I have checked the challenges pretty thoroughly, but it's still possible that there's an error somewhere.
